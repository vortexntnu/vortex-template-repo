## Using pre-commit

This project uses [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) to manage automated checks.

### Install pre-commit
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### Run all hooks manually
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Install the git hook
This will make the checks run automatically every time you `git commit`:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Update pre-commit hooks
```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```
